## Development

Requires npm.

Run dev-server with: `npm start`

Pull requests very welcome ^_^

## Tests

Integration-style tests are implemented using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io) and can be run with: `npm test`.

If you are already running the development webserver, you can run just the Cypress tests against that using `npm run cy:run`.

To run the tests interactively, use `npm run cy:open`.
